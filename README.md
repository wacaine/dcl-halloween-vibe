# Frankenstein Build (SDK7 Version)


Frankenstein build. Took multiple demos and mashed them together. Then instead of using inworld ai with colyseus did it with Digital Ocean and Firebase

Used

* Digital Ocean Agents for Chat
* Gemini for image creation and skinning
* Github copilot for coding assistant
* Cline for more advanced coding when copilot failed me
